# Data Analyst Portfolio
This ongoing project is meant to create a search function allowing the user to search the ZIP code of a thrift store and see the percentile scores of four categories of thrift shopping in that ZIP code. Functionality will be added to provide the user with a list of thrift stores in that ZIP and to rank all thrift stores by ZIP and health score.

## Technical Skills Utilized
* Python
* Data Visualization using numpy, scipy.stats, and matplotlib.pyplot
* Data analysis using pandas
* Excel (for creating the csv that the program uses)
